# Embedding Scrollback

You can easily embed Scrollback into your own website by following these simple steps:

### Step one: On the Scrollback website, create your own chat room. This chat-room will be the one which will get embedded into your site.

### Step two: Once the room is created, you will automatically be re-directed to your room's page. On your room's page, the left column will have all information about your room along with an option to 'embed script'.
