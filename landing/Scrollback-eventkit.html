<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
        <h2>Scrollback events</h2>
        <p>Scrollback events can be of different types, targetting different audience groups. Being an Open source project, developer centric events are always a focus, but we have also tried to find scopes for non-technical crowd during our events. 
        </p>
        <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/stvtOl1.jpg?1"></p>
        <h2>The different topics which an event organizer can cover during his/her Scrollback event are:</h2>
        <h3>Introduction to Scrollback</h3>
         <p>Every product, project or orgnization needs an introuction. At any Scrollback event, if we are targetting a set of audience who might not be very aware of Scrollback, we strongly recommend the event organizer (or facilitator) to take a few minutes to talk about this tool before jumping into any other topics.</p>

         <!-- <h3>Introduction to Scrollback</h3> -->
          <ol class="agenda">
          <li>What is Scrollback?</li>
          <li>Why did we build Scrollback?</li>
          <li>The different features of Scrollback</li>
          <li>As an example, you could refer to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/priynag/scrollback-intro-final" target="_blank">this presentation</a>.</li>
        </ol> <br>

        <h3>Community building</h3>
        <p>We say Scrollback is a tool for communities. Thus, taking a session on Community building might be a good idea. </p>
        <ol class="agenda">
          <li>What is a community?</li>
          <li>What makes a community successful?</li>
          <li>Required characteristics of a good community manager</li>
          <li>What are the different challenges within a community?</li>
          <li>As an example, you could refer to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/priynag/community-building-40011324" target="_blank">this presentation</a>.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <h3>IRC - what it is</h3>
        <p>Its wrong to assume that everyone, even if they have high technical skills, will be aware of IRC. IRC as a communication platform is often unknown to many. So, before talking about how an IRC channel can be connected to a Scrollback room, talking a little about IRC might be helpful. Another approach to it can be talking about how Scrollback is trying to connect the IRC users to the new contributors who are not on IRC yet.</p>
        <ol class="agenda">
          <li>What is IRC?</li>
          <li>Where and why are IRC used?</li>
          <li>How the current generation is choosing alternate communication platforms like facebook chats, whatsApps etc?</li>
          <li>How Scrollback is trying to be the bridge between conventional IRCs and the modern day's fancy looking chat platforms.</li>
          <li>As an example, you could refer to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/priynag/irc-in-the-age-of-social-media" target="_blank">this presentation</a>.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <h3>Open Source - what it is</h3>
        <p>Scrollback is an Open Source product. Scrollback cares about user's freedom. But, not all internet users of today's world understands what this 'freedom' is supposed to mean. So, for an organizer or facilitator, taking a session on Open Source might be a good idea.</p>
         <ol class="agenda">
            <li>What is Open Source?</li>
            <li>How does Open Source work?</li>
            <li>What is meant by community?</li>
            <li>Why should someone care about Open Source?</li>
            <li>How community involvement help someone in their career?</li>
            <li>How to get involved with communities?</li>
            <li>As an example, you could refer to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/priynag/the-open-source-world" target="_blank">this presentation</a>.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <h3>Scrollback campus ambassador program</h3>
        <p>The Scrollback Campus Ambassador program,or the Scrollback elevator programme as we call it, is designed to help campus students grow from being new contributors to finally being a part of the Scrollback core team. If you have campus students among your audience, this might be a good topic to spend some time on.</p>
        <ol class="agenda">
            <li>What is the Scrollback Campus Ambassador program?</li>
            <li>How can a student benifit from being a part of this program?</li>
            <li>What are the prerequisites to become a Scrollback Campus Ambassador?</li>
            <li>As an example, you could refer to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/priynag/scrollback-campusambassador" target="_blank">this presentation</a>.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <h3>Contributing to Scrollback</h3>
        <p>We often talk about project, products and how interesting they all are to us, forgetting to let our audience know the way in which they can start their contribution to these projects. As an event organizer or facilitator, this topic should always be included in your event's schedule.</p>
         <ol class="agenda">
            <li>What are the different ways in which one can contribute to Scrollback and how?</li>
            <li>As an example, you could refer to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/priynag/how-to-contribute-to-scrollback" target="_blank">this presentation</a>.</li>
        </ol><br>
