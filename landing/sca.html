                <h2>Whats in it for me?</h2>
                <p>At college level, we rarely get opportunities of working on live projects. All we end up doing is, learning loads of theory and implementing them in small (personal) projects. Only an Open Source organization like Scrollback can give the platform to work on live projects with experienced developers from across the globe. <br><br>

                Most importantly, if you are a believer of openness in technology and freedom to be able to use them , joining the Scrollback community can be your step closer to the global community of Free and Open Source Software lovers.</p>
