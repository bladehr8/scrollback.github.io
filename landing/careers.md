<h2>Geeks</h2>

<p>You’ll build stuff. This means one or more of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>writing the client (Web, PhoneGap)</li>
    <li>writing the server (Node.js)</li>
    <li>writing SDKs and plugins (various CMSs)</li>
    <li>UX+UI design (intolerance of bad UI, image editing, CSS)</li>
    <li>devops (CI, deployment, monitoring)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be working with a small but amazingly talented team of people.
Everyone does more than one thing, and we look for people who can wear
more than one hat.</p>

<p>While you must be quite familiar with JS (at the level of being able
to write, say, a simple ToDo app) knowing other languages and frameworks
is a definite advantage.</p>

<p>Key buzzwords that our work touches upon, but DO NOT need to be in
your resume: Isomorphic JavaScript, Redis, PostgreSQL, Social APIs
(Twitter, Facebook, Google), IRC, ML, NLP, SEO. We also expect to
begin work that uses APIs of other popular web services.</p>
