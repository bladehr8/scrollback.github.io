<h1> We’re hiring </h1>
<p>Scrollback is a seed-funded startup that wants to bring back a sense of community
to our online lives.</p>

<p>Most online media today are about finding new ways to connect you to people you already know — your friends and family or celebrities you’ve seen on TV. A decade ago the web was very different; forums and chat rooms let you connect with interesting new people who happen to share your interests. We believe there is value in those connections too — that's why we’re building Scrollback.</p>

<p>Scrollback aims to transform the user experience for online communities by combining the ease and engagement of chat with content organization of forums. It’s used by over 700 communities, including several regional communities of Mozilla, cryptocurrency communities like dogecoin, activist groups, tech conferences, comic blogs, online games and even municipalities.</p>

<h2>1. Geeks</h2>

<p>You’ll build stuff. This means one or more of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>writing the client (Web, PhoneGap)</li>
    <li>writing the server (Node.js)</li>
    <li>writing SDKs and plugins (various CMSs)</li>
    <li>UX+UI design (intolerance of bad UI, image editing, CSS)</li>
    <li>devops (CI, deployment, monitoring)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be working with a small but amazingly talented team of people
on a fully open source product.
Everyone does more than one thing, and we look for people who can wear
more than one hat.</p>

<p>While you must be quite familiar with JS (at the level of being able
to write, say, a simple ToDo app) knowing other languages and frameworks
(Android, iOS, Python, PHP) is a definite advantage.</p>

<p>Key buzzwords that our work touches upon, but DO NOT need to be in
your resume: Isomorphic JavaScript, Redis, PostgreSQL, Social APIs
(Twitter, Facebook, Google), IRC, ML, NLP, SEO. We also expect to
begin work that uses APIs of other popular web services.</p>
