# Scrollback
## Where communities hang out

Scrollback is a beautiful, open source text chat service designed for communities. 

Scrollback hosts rooms which you can embed into any webpage and link it with Twitter hashtags or IRC channels. A room brings together a long-lived, interactive community that is stickier and more engaging than any forum system. 

Sites like the [MixFlavor comic blog](http://blog.mixflavor.com/) use Scrollback to turn visitors into a friendly community. Scrollback believes that people who chat stay longer and return more often. 

At events like [RootConf](https://rootconf.in/2014/), Scrollback has allowed attendees to network more freely, share anecdotes related to the talks and have extended QA with speakers.

Scrollback can be a friendly portal to your IRC channel. Projects like Mozilla put their IRC channel on their website using Scrollback, so that visitors truly learn why it is called an open-source community.
