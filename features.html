# Features of Scrollback

####**Infinite scroll**
  Scroll up to see what people were talking about in the last hour - or last week.

####**Minimize ticker**
  Gently introduce casual visitors to your community with conversation that is never out of sight.

####**Subtle notifications**
  Notifications and timestamps appear when needed, then fade away to keep the focus on the conversation.

####**User colors**
  Quickly identify who's talking to whom, with colors that represent people consistently.

####**Timeline**
  See the peaks and troughs of conversation in a colorful visualization you can scroll through.

####**User history**
  Hover over a nickname to see that person's activity highlighted on the timeline.

####**IRC compatible**
  If an active IRC community exists, we gateway to it instead of competing with it.

####**Seamless integration**
  Let Scrollback match the fonts and styles of your website automatically, or customize it extensively with CSS.
