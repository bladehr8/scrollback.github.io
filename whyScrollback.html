# Why we built Scrollback

We're a team of developers who got tired of [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).

New chat systems have been appearing for the past 20 years, but they are all built for one-to-one or **private** conversations in small groups.

Open communities, on the other hand, are larger and **public** by default. These communities form around open source projects, consumer brands, sports teams, entertainment franchises and many more. They need different tools.

IRC is one - it is the great grand-daddy of social text chat - but it predates the web and mobile, and most users find it hopelessly complex and archaic.

Scrollback is a modern, beautifully designed platform for open communities to converse. It combines the lessons learned from IRC with the ease-of-use of an embeddable web app and the power of a cloud service.

Paul Graham [once said of Twitter](http://ycombinator.com/rfs3.html): "It is really more of a discovery than an invention; that square was always there in the periodic table of protocols, but no one had quite hit it squarely."	

IRC occupies a square in that table. Scrollback is in the same column, a few rows down.
