# Getting Started on Scrollback
### Simple steps to help you get started on Scrollback

 Once you are on Scrollback, you can do one of the following two things:
   1. Join an existing room
   2. Create a new room of your own

### 1. Joining an existing room
Click on the 'Get Started' button on the homepage. You will get a modal window which will ask you to enter the name of the room you want to create or join. If you want to join an existing chanel, simply enter its name and click 'Go'.
You will be redirected to your chatroom.

### **Configuring Scrollback**
(including IRC configuration)

You will be automatically re-directed to your created room. On your room's page, you will get options to configure your room.

<ul>
     <li> Link your chatroom to the appropriate twitter hashtags and twitter handles.</li>
     <li> Link your chatroom to some IRC channel.</li>
     <li> Decide whether you want search engines to index your room.</li>
     <li> Whether you want to apply 'word filter' on your room. This will prevent users from using abusive or unconstitutional words on your room.</li>

</ul>
