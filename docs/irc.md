title: Linking Scrollback and IRC
permalink: /docs/irc/
---

IRC is the great grand-daddy of social text chat - but it predates the web and mobile, and most users find it hopelessly complex and archaic.
New contributors often find IRCs and IRC clients un-user friendly and scary and thus they tend to move away from the community or the project.
Instead, Scrollback provides a very user-friendly platform where new users can easily hang around. If your community (or project) already has an IRC channel, you can simply create a room on Scrollback and link it to your IRC channel. Your room can now simply act like a IRC client which can make life easier for users as well as moderators. 

### How to link your Scrollback room with your IRC channel
You can refer to the Getting started page for more information about [creating a chat room on Scrollback and configuring it.](http://scrollback.github.io/gettingStarted.html) <br>
While configuring your chat room, you will find option for IRC setup. It will ask you for two parameters - your IRC server (eg. irc.freenode.in, irc.moznet.in) and the name of your IRC channel (eg. #ubuntu, #python).

Once you add these details and click on 'Done', you will receive a verification phrase which you will need to enter from your IRC channel as an authenticating factor before your IRC channel and the Scrollback room can be linked.
Once you complete the verification process, your Scrollback room will be linked to your IRC channel.
