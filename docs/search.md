If you have a very noisy room and are looking for some specific keyword within your room, it might be a difficult job. To simplify this task, you can use the search option on Scrollback.

### How to use the Scrollback search?
On the Scrollback chatroom, on the top right, you will find the search option.

You will be automatically redirected to the conversation which contains the searched word or phrase.
