#### How is Scrollback better than any other chat room?

Scrollback provides many features which other similar services doesn't. Like:

* Scrollback rooms can be linked with IRC channels.
* Scrollback rooms can be linked with different Twitter handles and hashtags.
* [Scrollback widgets can be embeded](/docs/embedding) into personal or community websites.
* All messages in a Scrollback room are automatically archived and grouped into discussions. A user can just go through the list of discussions in the 'Discussion' tab to get a quick idea of all that has happened in the room, without needing to read through all messages of the room.
* Scrollback gives users the ability to search for keywords in the room to quickly find the related message.

Most importantly, Scrollback is an Open Source project. If you are a user of Scrollback and also a developer, you have the entire codebase at your service to go and modify things in the way you want to. You might also want to contribute back a few of your own developed features to make Scrollback better.


#### Why use Scrollback when we already have WhatsApp?

WhatsApp works great for small groups. Think of a WhatsApp group with 200+ people (not that they don’t exist), all they do is create a lot of noise in the group to make it almost impossible for anyone to communicate or follow stuff in the group. Think of coming back from your day job and opening your whatsApp where there are 1000+ messages from a group which consist of 200+ people. Will you ever want to read it? Isn’t it a waste of time? 

On Scrollback, you can very easily visit the discussion tab of a room and at a glance check all that has been discussed in the room. You can read full messages of only those threads which are of your interest and concern.


#### How is Scrollback better than good old IRCs?
Setting up an IRC client is not always an easy task. Not that we don’t want contributors to learn those tricks, all we are trying to do is provide an alternative, easier platform.

Several communities have this issue where the ratio of the number of interested newcomers in the community vs the number of contributors who have actually started contribution have been shockingly different. One of the reasons for that is the lack of communication in the initial contribution days for the newbie. Due to the difficulty level of IRC setup, the newbies often decide to leave. Implementing Scrollback on the community websites can help solve that problem to a certain extend.


#### Doesn't having public rooms harm user privacy?

Scrollback wants to keep the user experience as close to IRC as possible and thus our rooms are all Open for anyone to join, much like the IRC channels.

But, unlike many other platforms, there are a lot of additional options provided by Scrollback, to maintain the decorum of a room:

* Only the room admin can link a room to an IRC channel. To make things even more secure, the room will not be linked to the IRC channel unless that IRC channel’s operator approves of the room linking.
* Only the room admin can link a room to a twitter handle or hashtags.
* The room admin can decide whether he (or she) want to allow anyone to be able to post in the room or only logged in users to be able to post in the room.
* The room admin can use the Spam control feature of a room configuration to block a few custom words from being used in the room.
