### Simple steps to help you get started on Scrollback

 Once you are on Scrollback, you can do one of the following two things:
   1. Join an existing room
   2. Create a new room of your own

#### 1. Joining an existing room
Click on the 'Get Started' button on the homepage. You will get a modal window which will ask you to enter the name of the room you want to create or join. If you want to join an existing chanel, simply enter its name and click 'Go'.
You will be redirected to your chatroom.

#### 2. Creating a new room on Scrollback
In the same modal window as above, enter the name of the room you want to create and click on 'Go'.

### Configuring Scrollback

If a room with that name already exists, you will be redirected to that room. If the room with the given name doesn't exist, you will be notified about it and asked if you want to create the room and claim it. Once you have claimed your room, you will get options to configure your room.

### Tweak the configuration options in the configuration page:

1. You can do the general settings for your room where you can change the name of your room and also give an appropriate description to your page.
2. You can link your chatroom to some IRC channel. Read more on how to link your Scrollback room to your IRC channel [here](http://scrollback.github.io/irc.html)
3. You can link your chatroom to the appropriate twitter hashtags and twitter handles.
4. You can decide whether you want to apply 'word filter' on your room and keep it from being spammed. This will prevent users from using abusive or unconstitutional words on your room.
5. You can decide whether you want search engines to index your room.
6. You can embed Scrollback into your own website. Read more on how to embed your Scrollback room into your own website [here](http://scrollback.github.io/embedding.html).
