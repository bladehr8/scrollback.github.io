### What are conversations?
Wikipedia describes Conversation as - "a form of interactive, spontaneous communication between two or more people who are following rules of etiquette." Scrollback has used the same concept to make conversations possible in its chat-rooms.

### How to find a conversation in my room on Scrollback?
When you visit your room (as an owner, moderator, follower or just a visitor), you can find a center menu with multiple tabs. The first tab lets you configure your room, the second tab shows you all the followers and members of the room and the last one shows 'All conversations'.
Under this 'All conversations' tab, you will find several different conversations that has happened in your room, all marked in different distinguisable colors.
